## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an overview of Citi Bike use time data of New York.  It will also do a demographic by gender.  This will help us to assess whether to start a similar program in Des Moines.

## Results
### Number of Riders

Here to give us an understanding of the data overall, we can see the number of riders in our dataset for August.

### Gender Breakdown

Male users make up the largest proportion of users in the dataset, though theres is still a substantial portion of female (and unknown).

### Checkout Times for Users

As we can see, trips are usually on the shorter end, less than an hour which will help to hone advertising for what the types of trips should be about.

### Checkout Times for Users by Gender

This graphic more or less confirms there are less female riders, but the time of use is about the same across gender.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

There is an interesting circle shape which seems to indicate that greatest use is on the weekends, as well as during commuter times during the weekday.

Similar to other comparisons this more or less confirms there are less female riders, but the times used are the same across gender.

It appears that subscribers make great use of this service by comparison with non-subscribers, though again there doesn't appear to be a difference by gender.

## Summary
Overall this seems like a good way to go about planning a Des Moines location.  In particular we should focus on advertising shorter trips on the weekday, and longer trips on the weekend (but not too long).  However there does not appear to be a significant difference in behavior between gender, though there are significantly more males who use the service which should be taken into consideration.

Lastly, an greater analysis on subscribers vs customers, as by quantity of each and perhaps their use times as we did by gender could be greatly helpful in terms of establishing the business model.
